        <h1>Math Racer</h1>
        <div class="body-callout">
          I created this iOS app to help elementary students improve their basic
          math skills. I wanted to make a game where students would test their
          math skills, come back, practice, and improve. In the app, students
          choose a mathematical operation and difficulty level, then answer math
          problems to race their car against the opponent driver.

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <div class="body-detail">
          The game includes several elements that achieve two goals of allowing
          students to test their skills and encourage practice. The first, being
          a character that appears throughout the application, encouraging and
          congratulating the students. The character creates a familiar face
          that children recognize and provides a connection that simply
          answering math problems doesn't allow. The second element is the star
          system. For each combination of operation and difficulty level, the
          students earn stars that track their progress, and encourages them to
          come back and practice and improve their skills as they level up. The
          app became much more enjoyable and engaging with the inclusion of
          these two features. After initial development, I playtested the game
          with elementary students to fine tune to difficulty parameters and
          discover usability issues.

        <div class="body-detail">
          I released the iPad application to the iOS store where it was
          downloaded tens of thousands of times and resulted in nearly half a
          million math problems answered.
